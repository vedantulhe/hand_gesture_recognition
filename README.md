# hand_gesture_recognition

Our Hand Gesture Recognition Project represents a cutting-edge advancement in the field of computer vision and human-computer interaction. Utilizing deep learning techniques, our project aims to accurately classify and interpret hand gestures, enabling seamless interaction with digital systems and devices. The system is designed to recognize 11 distinct hand gestures: like, dislike, two up, peace sign, call gesture, rock sign, fist, four fingers, three fingers, one finger, and stop gesture.

With a comprehensive dataset consisting of 11,000 images, each gesture category is extensively represented, ensuring robustness and accuracy in recognition. Each gesture category is meticulously curated, with 1,000 images collected for precise training and testing.
